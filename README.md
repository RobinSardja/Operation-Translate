## Inspiration
Operation Translate is inspired by the post-apocalyptic need to learn as many languages as you can to ensure proper communication with anyone you may end up meeting.

## What it does
Operation Translate gamifies traditional language learning apps with a roleplay game as a spy.

## How we built it
Operation Translate was built with Dart, Flutter, and Gemini.

## Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge was ensuring that all outputs fitted the format we needed to parse the text. We solved this with optimizing the prompt to enforce the necessary restrictions.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of creating a new way to learn languages with a secret agent roleplaying game.

## What we learned
We learned that the best way to make a learning process fun and exciting is to gamify it!

## What's next for Operation Translate
Operation Translate can continue development by featuring more languages, greater variety in conversation topics, and implementing a ranking system for users to compete with each other.
